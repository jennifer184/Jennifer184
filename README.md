 <h4>IoT Remote Cat Feeder with Webcam using Raspberry Pi</h4>
 A personal fun project to feed my cats breakfast and dinner so I didn't have to. I added a 
 remote feeding feature paired with a webcam to help me decide on the optimal amount of 
 food to deliver them. This little project allowed my to go on small trip while not having 
 to board them or hire anyone since I could monitor their food, water, litter, and make 
 adjustments remotely. (Python, hardware, Bash, Yawcam, Remote SSH)
