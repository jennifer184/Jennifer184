  <h4> Software testing evaluation on Pynguin </h4>
During my four-month individual graduate project, I conducted a comprehensive assessment of the effectiveness of Pynguin's autogenerated unit tests within the context of an open-source Python software, Backtrader. To ensure a representative evaluation, I selected 25 modules, organizing them into five distinct groups. I then executed each group with Pynguin, utilizing default configurations. Throughout this process, I gathered data on several key metrics, including the time required to generate each test suite, the total number of tests generated for each module, the pass or fail rate as determined by Pytest, the achieved statement coverage, and the mutation score assessed using MutPy.

One notable observation from my analysis was the inconsistency in Pynguin's ability to produce passing tests. It is plausible that the imposed 10-minute time limit may have constrained Pynguin's capacity to generate more robust tests, which could have accounted for this variability. Furthermore, the average statement coverage achieved in each batch run fell short of benchmark standards, contrasting with results reported in previous empirical research involving Pynguin. Intriguingly, all unit tests attained a 100% mutation score, successfully eliminating all mutants. (Python, Bash, Pynguin, MutPy, Pytest, git)

 <!-- github game -->

  <img src="/images/game_screenshot.png" align="right" width=40% height=40%><h4> Github Game </h4> A personal project inspired by a quick youtube video ( https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0TTpXDYnAg8), This was a difficult project to recreate becasue the starter code did not work and there were huge gaps in the implementation. After building a simple functional web app hosted by PythonAnywhere, I upped the ante and refactored the code to meet the object oriented paradigm, and included custom html pages to show what hand the player chose v.s. the computer's. I was also fusturated with running into games that didn't work, so implemented a custom Github badge using Shields.io that would let the player know that this game was up and working. To do this, the app additionaly updates a json that the badge can refer to every hour and display on my Github readme. (Python, CSS, HTML, JSON, PythonAnywhere, Shields.io)

  <h4> Test analysis on Apache Commons Lang API Project </h4>
 A 4 month group project where we developed new unit tests, added auto generated test, and researched which regression tools worked best at bringing down the total time and number of tests requried to run after changes were made. Ekstazi ran fewer test after changes but HyRts ran faster. (Java, JUnit, Python, git, PIT, Maven, Randoop, EvoSuite, Ekstazi, HyRts)

      <h4> &nbsp; Mobile Trip Planning App Project </h4>
    <p> &nbsp; A 4 month project with a group of 5, where we added new features to bring the app to full functionality. I implemented a dynamicly populated list of places choosen by the user to create a trip planner and later converted it to a drag and drop list. Additionaly, I added the ability to upload and download the trip in a svg map with corditinates and lines to represent the total path of the users trip. For the back-end, I helped optimize the trip distance, and sped up client/server communication to under 1 second by troubleshooting with Postman.

 <h4>IoT Remote Cat Feeder with Webcam using Raspberry Pi</h4>
 A personal project to expand my newly learned Python programing skills, save me some time, and ensure consistent feeding times with the correct amounts. I also added a 
 remote feeding feature paired with a webcam to help me decide on the optimal amount of 
 food to deliver them. This little project also allowed my to go on small trip while not having 
 to board them or hire anyone since I could monitor their food, water, litter, and make 
 adjustments remotely. (Python, hardware, Bash, Yawcam, Remote SSH)
